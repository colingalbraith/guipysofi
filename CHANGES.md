# Changes from Original Code

This document summarizes the changes made during the refactoring of the original monolithic `Sofi.py` file into a well-structured, maintainable, and high-performance Python package.

## Architectural Improvements

1. **Modular Architecture**: Separated the code into logical components:
   - `core/`: Core data handling and processing
   - `ui/`: User interface components
   - `utils/`: Helper utilities

2. **Proper Python Package Structure**:
   - Added `setup.py` for installation
   - Created proper package hierarchy
   - Added documentation
   - Added unit tests

3. **Dependency Management**:
   - Explicit dependencies in `setup.py`
   - Optional performance dependencies
   - Development dependencies for contributors

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Multithreading**:
   - Parallel processing for compute-intensive operations
   - Thread pooling for I/O operations
   - Thread-safety improvements

2. **Memory Management**:
   - Better cleanup of resources
   - Explicit garbage collection
   - Reduced memory footprint

3. **Computational Optimizations**:
   - JIT compilation with Numba where applicable
   - Vectorized operations with NumPy
   - Optimized algorithms for core computations

4. **I/O Optimizations**:
   - Asynchronous file operations
   - More efficient TIFF handling
   - Better file size checks

## Code Quality Improvements

1. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - Data management separated from UI
   - Visualization separated from data processing
   - Core algorithms separated from I/O

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Comprehensive exception handling
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Proper error reporting

3. **Documentation**:
   - Extensive docstrings
   - Comprehensive user documentation
   - API reference

4. **Testing**:
   - Unit tests for core functionality
   - Test fixtures
   - Mock objects for testing

## UI Improvements

1. **Better Responsiveness**:
   - Non-blocking UI during processing
   - Progress updates
   - Status reporting

2. **Code Organization**:
   - Clean separation of UI components
   - Improved event handling
   - Better resource management

## Open Source Project Setup

1. **Project Documentation**:
   - README with installation and usage instructions
   - Full documentation
   - License file

2. **Contributor-Friendly**:
   - Clear project structure
   - Well-documented code
   - Development setup instructions

3. **Distribution**:
   - PyPI-ready package
   - Console entry point
   - Easy installation
